	<h1>Obstacle Avoid Line Following Robot</h1>

<body>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<p>1.Gather all the required components, including an Arduino microcontroller, motor driver module, IR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and chassis.</p>
<p>2.Assemble the robot chassis, ensuring that it has enough space to accommodate the sensors and other components.</p>
<p>3.Connect the motor driver module to the Arduino board, following the instructions provided by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>4.Connect the IR sensors to the Arduino board, ensuring that they are connected to the correct pins.</p>
<p>5.Connect the ultrasonic sensors to the Arduino board, following the instructions provided by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>6.Write the Arduino code to control the robot's movements and detect obstacles using the sensors.</p>
<p>7.Test the code and make any necessary adjustments to ensure that the robot is functioning correctly.</p>
<p>8.Place the robot on a line and test its line-following capabilities. Adjust the sensors as necessary to ensure that the robot is staying on the line.</p>
<p>9.Test the obstacle-avoidance capabilities by placing obstacles in the robot's path. Ensure that the robot is stopping to avoid collisions.</p>
<p>10.Once the robot is working as intended, make any final adjustments and improvements as necessary.</p>
